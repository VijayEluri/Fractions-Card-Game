# Fractions-Card-Game
This was a card game that initially started as a paper prototype to help 4th graders make part-whole operations on fractions.
It was then converted into a multi-player and single player version of that same game, trying to keep as much of the original gameplay that was done face to face as possible.

Unfortunately, it's not well commented at the moment.
